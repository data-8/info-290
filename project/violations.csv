I know I'll pay $200 to have a piece of my art on that wall. It's like paying to build a statue of you . .... Maybe place a team of The chosen ones on their areas or wall ,.....talk out their idea to the theme given to them by the city or whatever runs it . Maybe even awarding them at the end of it a thank you for their participation. I can highly assure noone would want to paint over it with graffiti . If it's something that relates to everybody family parents friends and kids. It would inspire and motivate our youth to a different idea when they feel like creating art . And not on street walls Otherwise we could just keep hiring the same 50 year old painter that touches up every week on a new graffiti tag on private property walls .i'll leave this saying there's a difference between graffiti and murals ,graffiti calls for challenge while murrals stan with respect.
